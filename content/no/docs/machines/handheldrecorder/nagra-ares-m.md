### Beskrivelse

Fra nettsiden:

High quality solid-state audio recorder, the ARES-M was principally designed to be used in any ultra-portable recording situation, and can replace MINIDISK©. Its recording media is a 1 GB built-in memory, for the recording of PCM Mono or Stereo audio. MPEG compression allows for longer recording times. The unit is powered by two “AA” batteries, offering more than 10 hours operation.

Fra manualen:

The ARES-M is designed as a flexible hand-held recorder for a variety of applications. It can perform many functions, which are all covered in this manual. The operating concept is designed around a system of preset TEMPLATES in which all the required operating modes are stored. The user can choose different parameters of the machine and these personalised settings are stored in a template for future quick access. There are two sets of templates, one for the compression mode to be used and the other for different input devices. If no specific user Template profiles are stored then the ARES-M will operate using the “default” factory settings.
