### Kort beskrivelse

Fra manualen:

"The X1 S is a high-quality condenser microphone intended for a wide range of studio applications, from vocals to drums to acoustic instruments and beyond. Thanks to its custom design and hand-
crafted 1” true condenser capsule, it delivers pristine sound quality and an even, well-balanced frequency response.

The electronics and the switchable attenuation pads ensure a high dynamic range, with high sound pressure level (SPL) handling capability and extremely low-noise components. The switchable low cut filters eliminate rumble or footfall noise, and can also compensate for an excess of bass frequencies caused by the proximity effect. This enables the X1 S to close-mic many instruments including electric guitar speaker cabinets, brass instruments and drums.

Reliable operation even in demanding on-stage applications in difficult environments is ensured by the roadworthy all-metal design, robust construction, and high quality manufacturing standards"
