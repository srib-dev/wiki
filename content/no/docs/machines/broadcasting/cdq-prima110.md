### Beskrivelse

Fra Manualen:

The CDQ Prima is an audio codec that is used to compress and decompress audio for transmission over a digital facility such as ISDN, dedicated data service, and satellite. Along with its audio compression capabilities, the CDQ Prima has a rich set of monitor and control (M&C) features made possible by a powerful on-board control processor and special command language. These M&C capabilities give you unique capabilities you will not find in audio-only codecs.

(...)The CDQ Prima Model 110 is conveniently packaged in a 1U – 1.75 inch (4.45 cm) by 19 inch (48.3 cm) – rack mount unit. The Model 110 provides a rich set of basic features that are included in the entire CDQ Prima family, such as stereo bi-directional audio, an LCD display, and a control keypad with beeper. The keypad allows operation of all the codec features. The Model 110 also includes a rear panel RS-232/RS-485 remote control connector, provisions for four optional optically isolated switching inputs and four control relay outputs. The
Model 110 may also be optionally equipped with AES/EBU or S/PDIF digital audio inputs and outputs. As with all CDQ Prima Series codecs,
the capacity for ancillary data is also included. It also contains a sophisticated, programmable audio level sensing and adjustable input and output levels. All 100 Series models can be equipped with four relay outputs and four optically isolated inputs. One Digital Interface Module (DIM) must be specified to interface with digital networks.

For å kunne kontrollere denne enheten, trenger man tilsynelatende et windows-program som heter _IntelliPrima_. Se kilder for mer info.
