### Kort beskrivelse

Fra manualen:

"The PowerWalker VFI 1000-3000 RMG PF1 is a professional UPS for commercial applications featuring Unity Power Factor (PF=1.0) and a very strong charger with adjustable current. Allows connecting loads with half-wave imbalance (i.e., laser printers and ultrasound systems) and provides generator support.

Multiple accessories, including battery packs and communication cards, enhance the functionality of the UPS and allow a greater backup time. The system can be monitored locally via an LCD panel or remotely via the PowerWalker ViewPower software. With its slim design it only requires 2U of valuable space of your rack system. The UPS can be installed in a 19” rack system or used as a tower."
